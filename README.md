# Venix
Venix is designed to improve your internet latency by changing things like TCP and DNS settings.

This is the batch file from the tweakcentral.net website. It's almost three years old now, and I don't recommend using it because it could harm/worsen your ping, latency, and download/upload speeds. The file downloaded from the website is encrypted and cannot be read. However, I decrypted it and decided to post it here. Please have fun with it!
